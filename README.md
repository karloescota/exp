# Exp

A barebones Exp-enses tracker. This web app allows you to record your expenses and income and helps you budget your finances.

We were personally using a free expenses tracker app on mobile and I decided to build this as a challenge. This is still a work in a progress but already useable. Just sprinkle more elixir into it. ;)

Built using Elixir and Phoenix and running LiveView!

## Development

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
